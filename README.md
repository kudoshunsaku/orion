Introducing the thin browser "Orion."
This new browser is named after the winter constellation Orion.

Orion Browser
https://orionbrowser.com/

I'm having trouble with Chrome being slow,
so I'm hoping that the Windows version will be completed soon.

I'm getting excited, so I'll have a little fun.
I'll try writing some working code.

It's a game similar to drawing fortunes.
I think you'll be able to get a feel for the history of browsers.

Fun and Learn.
